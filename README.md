# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Description

- Intro
- Figma
- Images
- Footer

The project serves a landing page to a display of images that are displayed using grid and flex. To create all this, a figma design was used to aid in the creation.
**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.
